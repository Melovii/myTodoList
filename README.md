### What I Learned

* Local storage management for saving and loading projects and tasks using the Web Storage API
* Event handling for adding and deleting tasks and projects
* Object-oriented programming for task management
* Importing and exporting JavaScript modules using ES6 syntax
* Dynamic rendering of tasks and projects in the UI

### Code

The code for this project is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Webpack build tool and the Lodash library.

### Future Improvements
